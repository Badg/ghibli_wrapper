# Ghibli wrapper

A simple wrapper around the Studio Ghibli public api.

[![CI](https://github.com/Badg/ghibli_wrapper/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Badg/ghibli_wrapper/actions)

Mostly written for the obvious reasons ðŸ˜Š, but I also wanted to learn a bit. In particular, since I'm slowly chipping away on my own web framework smiliar to fastAPI (link: [annoliate](https://github.com/Taev-dev/annoliate)), I was interested in:

+   using fastAPI for the first time!
+   getting more familiar with pydantic, which I'm actually using behind the hood in annoliate anyways. In particular, it was a good excuse to write my first custom type
+   getting VCR.py to work with python-asks

### Some (important!) caveats

+   I started out writing this with [Trio](https://github.com/python-trio/trio), since I've used it extensively and it has some really nice async semantics that make it much, much easier to write correct, robust async code. That being said, fastAPI doesn't support it natively, and the code here is so simple that most of the benefits you get are around clean cancellation APIs, signal handling, etc. Tons of "ink" has been spilled about Trio; the [``trio-asyncio`` docs](https://trio-asyncio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) give a nice overview of the pros/cons. Arguably I should have stuck with asyncio here, but by the time I came to that conclusion, I had already written a bunch of tests using ``pytest-trio``, so it was faster to just keep using it for tests, while switching to plain asyncio for the app itself. So... that's definitely less than ideal. If I had more time, I would go with one or the other.
+   I didn't have time to implement any configuration whatsoever, so what little configuration was needed (I think just port number) is hard-coded in ``__main__.py``
+   The test code is really sloppy, especially for the cache. I was low on time, and it was more important to me to have better test coverage than to have all the tests be well-written (that being said, I didn't actually implement a coverage measurement, so it's all just my approximation)
+   The cache API and, frankly, internal logic could probably use some work, but cacheing is really tricky to get right, application-specific, and time-consuming

### Some lessons learned

+   Pydantic's API has some rough edges around custom types
+   I don't want to use VCR.py with python-asks
+   freezegun documentation comes from the most recent github commit, which is ahead of freezegun's current pypi version. Guess when freezegun added support for time.monotonic?
+   FastAPI has, like, a single line of operational code that uses asyncio, but doesn't currently run on windows using Trio, see [here](https://github.com/python-trio/trio-asyncio/issues/85)

## Installation, usage, tests

### With ``poetry``

```bash
# ----- Installation ------
git clone <repo>
poetry install
# ----- Usage ------
poetry run python -m ghibli_wrapper
# ----- Running tests ------
poetry run python -m pytest --import-mode=importlib
```

### With ``pip``

```bash
# ----- Installation ------
git clone <repo>
# In your favorite venv
pip install .
# ----- Usage ------
python -m ghibli_wrapper
# ----- Running tests ------
python -m pytest --import-mode=importlib
```

**Note: this requires a relatively new ``pip`` version** (I believe ``19.0.0`` or above, but don't quote me on that; I tested with 19.2.3).

## Style guide notes

Formatted per pep8 but not pep257. Specifics are in ``.flake8``, but the potentially contentious decisions ones are:

+   Max line length 79 characters
+   Break lines after binary operators, not before ([opinions on this are changing](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7942586/correct-style-for-line-breaks-when-chaining-methods-in-python/7942617#7942617))
+   Import statements are alphabetized and grouped:
    1.  ``import <stdlib>``
    2.  ``from <stdlib> import <x>``
    3.  (empty line)
    4.  ``import <thirdparty_dep>``
    5.  ``from <thirdparty_dep> import <y>``
    6.  (empty line)
    7.  ``import <internal_dep>``
    8.  ``from <internal_dep> import <z>``
+   Import statements always use full absolute names, eg ``from ghibli_wrapper.utils import <x>``, not ``from .utils import <x>``
+   Docstrings:
    *   Triple single quotes, not triple double (I recognize this is in direct opposition to pep257)
        -   I do this purely for ergonomic reasons
        -   It just occurred to me that in all my years I never really learned to use the left shift, so maybe I'll start changing that
        -   Pre-commit hooks are great for normalizing docstrings anyways
    *   No line break on first line of docstr (``'''Foo...``, not ``'''\nFoo``)
    *   Closing triple quotes on dedicated line
    *   No blank line before closing triple quotes
